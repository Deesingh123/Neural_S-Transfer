Neural Style Transfer: Content and Style Fusion Using Deep Learning

This repository demonstrates the application of Neural Style Transfer (NST), a technique in deep learning that allows us to blend the content of one image with the style of another. 
The project utilizes the VGG19 model, a pre-trained convolutional neural network, to extract feature representations from both content and style images. 
These features are then used to compute content loss and style loss, which guide the optimization of the generated image, ensuring it retains the content of the first image while adopting 
the artistic style of the second.

Key steps include:

Preprocessing of the input images (resizing, normalization).
Feature extraction using VGG19 for content and style representation.
Calculation of content loss and style loss through Gram matrices.
Optimization of the generated image to minimize the total loss, using the Adam optimizer.
Final output: Displaying the stylized image along with comparisons to the original content and style images.
This project demonstrates how deep learning models can be creatively used for artistic purposes, providing a practical approach to image generation and artistic style transfer. 
Itâ€™s a great starting point for anyone interested in applying deep learning to creative tasks such as image editing and artistic synthesis.
